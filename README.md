## üéØ Problem Statement

Develop an interactive application using Streamlit or Chainlit that allows users to upload a PDF, converts its content into embeddings, and enables question-answering via an LLM.

## üöÄ How It Works: ARCHITECTURE

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Your PDF  
It all starts with a simple drag-and-drop, just upload your document.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Extract the Content  
After uploading click on the PROCESS button, the app uses PyPDF2 to read your PDF and present the content in a human-readable format. Say goodbye to endless scrolling through pages.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate Smart Embeddings  
The magic happens here! Using Google Gemini AI models, the app converts text into embeddings‚Äîcompact representations of information‚Äîso it "understands" your document.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Ask Questions, Get Answers  
Curious about a specific topic? Just ask! The app searches its knowledge base and provides context-aware answers.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dive Deeper  
Got multiple documents? Enable cross-PDF querying to connect the dots between related topics.
